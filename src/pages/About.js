              Stephani
            </h3>
            <p>
              Stephani is the vice director of Yada Youth Indonesia, who is
              currently a student in the University of Gadjah Mada. Throughout
              high school, she was known to be an active student with a good
              academic standing, graduating with a GPA of 3.8 out of 4.0. She is
              heavily infatuated with human connectivity in social
              organizations. Stephaniâ€™s endeavors in the advocacy for Children
              began in 2019 as she served as a fundraiser in UNICEF Indonesia
              for the campaign of providing sanitation and education for Papuan
              Children. She then continued to take the role of a development
              volunteer at Karunia Orphanage, an orphanage especially built for
              Papuan Orphans in Surabaya. Stephani fights for the belief that
              children regardless of background should be handed the same
              opportunities as those who are born into more privileged
              situations and is currently fighting for the cause through Yada
              Youth Indonesia.
