          Have you ever wondered how important it is the playing phase for
          children? Contrary to popular belief, playing holds more than just
          entertainment objectives. It contributes to the intellectual growth
          and construction in children that are crucial in their
          self-development and maturity.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          These factors play a vital role in determining their future
          livelihood. Through the correct tool, environment, and supervision,
          playtime can be a valuable learning experience. Thus, we encourage
          Yada friends to support and realize how important this process is in a
          childâ€™s playing stages.

          So, What does playing mean in this context?
        </h2>
        <p className="my-4 ">
          Playing is investigating new ways of doing things, and developing
          imaginative competence and problem-solving skills (Sutton Smith,
          1997). It is seen as a creative process to the onlooker, yet makes
          absolute sense and has grounded reasoning to the children involved
          (Moyles, 2005)

        <li className="my-4">
          It provides a foundation for enabling self-understanding through doing
          and testing social and emotional relationships and is a catalyst for
          self choice when it is child-initiated and child-led (Hughes, 2001)
        </li>
        <li className="my-4">
          A child from an early age in a play situation can develop a sense of
          what they like and dislike, who they want to share their play space
          with who they don't. Making simple decisions without immediate
          consequences empowers children to develop a sense of who they are
          (Bauman & May, 2001).
        </li>
        <li className="my-4">
          To a child, the they are involved in a construction of knowledge,
          ideas meanings (Mayall, 2001).
        </li>
        <li className="my-4">
          Erikson (1963) observed that play has an ego-building function, aiding
          the development of self-esteem. The child is able to demonstrate their
          personality within paradigm of play and the boundaries they have set.
          This provide an environment in which the child can explore
          understanding of themselves and therefore subconsciously support their
          emotional development.
        </li>
        <li className="my-4">
          Holme and Massie (1970) agree that play and socialization with peers
          are independent in supporting an aware of self their emotions. There
          responses support the construction of children's development self. In
          play children are able to develop skills of self understanding and
          discovery.
        </li>
        <li className="my-4">
          When Children are engaged in playful situations they are able to
          maintain a sense of flexibility and freedom which can capture a
          child's concentration and state of mind and enable a sense of being at
          one with the environtment (Csikszentmihalyu, 1979).
